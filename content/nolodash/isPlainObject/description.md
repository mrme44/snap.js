To check if your value is a "plain object" like `{ x: 2 }`

```javascript
[null, Object.prototype].includes(Object.getPrototypeOf(value));
```

The above type-detection mechanisms has the flaw that it does not work with cross-realm values. For example, if you receive an object from across an iframe boundary, that object's prototype would link to the iframe's `Object`, not your `Object`, and the above checks would fail to recognize it as a plain object. A cross-realm compatible solution could look something like this (depending how spoof-proof you want it to be):

```javascript
function isPlainObject(value) {
  if (value === null || value === undefined) {
    return false;
  }

  const protoOf = Object.getPrototypeOf;
  if (protoOf(value) === null) {
    return true;
  }

  const objectConstructorAsString = 'function Object() { [native code] }';
  return (
    protoOf(protoOf(value)) === null &&
    typeof protoOf(value).constructor === 'function' &&
    Function.prototype.toString.call(protoOf(value).constructor) === objectConstructorAsString
  );
}
```

Unfortunately you can't have an is-plain-object check that's both cross-realm-compatible and spoof-proof. The algorithm presented above can be spoofed as follows:

```javascript
class SpecialClass {
  static {
    Object.setPrototypeOf(SpecialClass.prototype, null)
    // This doesn't literally change the class's constructor,
    // it just changes an informational property to be a lie.
    SpecialClass.prototype.constructor = Object;
  }
}

isPlainObject(new SpecialClass()); // true
```

Even Lodash's algorithm can be spoofed.

```javascript
class SpecialClass {
  static {
    SpecialClass.prototype.constructor = Object;
  }
}

_.isPlainObject(new SpecialClass()); // true
```

If you're in need of a plain-object check for your API, it might be worth seeing if there are alternative API designs that you could run with that don't depend on behaviors that can't be implemented reliably in JavaScript.

Some very early JavaScript proposals may provide support for cross-realm type checking:

* [Pattern matching's built-in matchers](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching#built-in-custom-matchers-1)
