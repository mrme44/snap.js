```javascript
const isObject = value => ['object', 'function'].includes(typeof value) && value !== null;

// A "plain" object is an object who's a direct instance of Object
// (or, who has a null prototype).
const isPlainObject = value => {
  if (!isObject(value)) return false;
  const prototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(value);
  return prototype === null || prototype === Object.prototype;
};

// NOTE: This mutates `object`.
// It also may mutate anything that gets attached to `object` during the merge.
function mergeWith(object, sources, customizer) {
  for (const source of sources) {
    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(source)) {
      const mergedValue = customizer(object[key], value, key, object, source, stack);
      if (mergedValue !== undefined) {
        object[key] = mergedValue;
        continue;
      }
      // Otherwise, fall back to default behavior

      if (value === undefined) {
        continue;
      }

      // These checks are a week attempt at mimicking the various edge-case behaviors
      // that Lodash's `_.merge()` exhibits. Feel free to simplify and
      // remove checks that you don't need.
      if (!isPlainObject(value) && !Array.isArray(value)) {
        object[key] = value;
      } else if (Array.isArray(value) && !Array.isArray(object[key])) {
        object[key] = value;
      } else if (!isObject(object[key])) {
        object[key] = value;
      } else {
        mergeWith(object[key], value, customizer)
      }
    }
  }

  return object;
}
```

Note that the Lodash implementation would pick both own and inherited properties from the default objects, while this implementation does not. In practice, this shouldn't matter much because 1. Generally, your default objects won't have inherited fields, and 2. Even if they did, if those inherited fields are set up "properly" (i.e. the same way the class syntax automatically does for you), they should also be non-enumerable, and Lodash's `_.merge()` does not pick non-enumerable fields from the defaults object.

In Lodash, the customizer function would be called with a sixth "stack" argument. Some probing shows that it's an instance of an internal "Stack" class, that provides some methods which, presumably, can be used to gather information about the objects you're merging. Due to the fact that this seems to be a rather complex feature that's entirely undocumented, it'll be assumed that the vast majority of users do not use this parameter, and so it's functionality won't be recreated here in vanilla JavaScript either.
